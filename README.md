# 🦁 Wildlife Sighting and Booking Management System

## 📌 Project Description
The **Wildlife Sighting and Booking Management System** is a DBMS-based web application designed to manage wildlife tourism activities efficiently. The system includes three user roles: **Tourist**, **Tourist Guide**, and **Administrator**. Tourists can book safaris, guides record wildlife sightings, and admins manage users, bookings, and safari operations.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate wildlife safari booking process  
- Maintain structured records of wildlife sightings  
- Apply core Database Management System concepts  
- Provide role-based access and secure data handling

## 👥 User Roles

### 🧍 Tourist
- Register and log in  
- View available safari packages  
- Book wildlife safaris  
- View booking history  
- Explore wildlife sightings  

### 🧭 Tourist Guide
- Log in securely  
- View assigned safari bookings  
- Record wildlife sightings (animal, location, date, description)  
- Update safari status  

### 🛠️ Administrator
- Manage tourists and guides

## 🗄️ Database Design
The system uses a **relational database** with the following tables:
- Users  
- Safaris  
- Bookings  
- Tourist_Guides  
- Wildlife_Sightings  

DBMS concepts used include:
- Primary and Foreign Keys  
- Normalization (up to 3NF)  
- SQL CRUD operations  
- Constraints and referential integrity

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** PHP  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Server:** XAMPP

## 🔐 Security Features
- Role-based authentication  
- Session management  
- Input validation to prevent SQL Injection  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Online payment integration  
- Mobile application support  
- Real-time wildlife tracking  
- Advanced reporting and analytics
